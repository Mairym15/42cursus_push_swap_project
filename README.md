# Push_swap: Stack It Like It’s Hot 🔥

## Project Overview 📋

**push_swap** is a sorting algorithm challenge where the goal is to sort a stack of integers (`stack a`) using a specific set of operations. 
The objective is to generate the **shortest possible sequence of instructions** that sorts the stack in ascending order, with the smallest number on top.

Performance is measured by the number of operations used, and a lower number of operations results in a higher score.

## How To Use 🔧

1. Compile the program with `Make`
2. Run the program with:
3. ```
   ./push_swap [list_of_integers]
4. Optional: use the checker to validate that the sorting works properly:
5. ```
   ./push_swap [list_of_integers] | ./checker [list_of_integers]

## Challenges I Faced 🧠

Some of the toughest challenges in this project included:

- **Optimizing Sorting Operations**: Finding the most efficient sequence of operations to minimize the number of moves.
- **Using Linked Lists Instead of Arrays**: Although I was more comfortable using arrays for data storage, I chose to implement the algorithm using linked lists for better memory efficiency and flexibility.
  This earned me the unofficial title of *Queen of Linked Lists* from a few fellow students! 👑
- **Memory Management**: Preventing memory leaks and ensuring efficient use of dynamic memory for the stack.

## What I Learned 🚀

Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of **sorting algorithms** 📊, **data structures**, and the importance of **efficiency** ⚡. 
I also had the opportunity to apply my get_next_line function while coding the checker, which helped reinforce my skills in **memory management** and **input handling**.
